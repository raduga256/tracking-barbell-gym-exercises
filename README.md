The aim of this project is try reproduce a research paper explores the possibilities of context-aware applications within the strength training domain.
It does so by analyzing wristband accelerometer and gyroscope data obtained during strength training sessions. The collected dataset contains
data of 5 participants performing various barbell exercises. The goal is to
explore, build, and evaluate models that can, just like human personal
trainers, track exercises, count repetitions, and detect improper form.
The methods evaluated in this paper use a supervised learning approach
for classification. Various machine learning algorithms were trained using
the collected dataset and accuracies were compared to find and evaluate
the right models.


## Background
During the last decade, many practical constraints related to carry-on sensors
like accelerometers, gyroscopes and GPS-receivers have been solved. This has enabled monitoring and classification of human activity based on information from
wearables such as smartwatches to become a growing research area of pattern
recognition and machine learning. The grounds for that lie in high commercial
potential of context-aware applications and user interfaces. Moreover, activity
recognition can be utilized to attack some of the serious societal challenges like
rehabilitation, sustainability, elderly care and health.
To promote healthier lifestyles, works from the past have focused on tracking
movements and user feedback via exercise management systems. Such systems
partly replace tasks that are currently fulfilled by personal trainers. For example,

in the category of aerobic exercises such as bicycling, swimming, and running,
there are accelerometer and GPS-based pedometers to track running pace and
distance, ECG monitors to track exertion, and electronic exercise machines such
as treadmills, elliptical trainers, stair climbers, and stationary bikes. Weight
training, in addition to aerobic exercises, is an important component of a balanced exercise program.
